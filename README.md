# Macroeconomic Factor Model

The provided code includes a factor model implemented in Python using the pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, os, yfinance, and pandas_datareader libraries. The factor model aims to analyze stock returns and their relationship with macroeconomic factors. Here's a description of the factor model implemented in the code:

The get_stock_returns_and_macro_factors function retrieves stock returns and macroeconomic factors from the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) API and processes the data. It retrieves data for the S&P 500 index and various macroeconomic indicators. The data is resampled on an annual basis and filtered to exclude specific date ranges (e.g., financial crisis and pandemic periods). The function returns the stock returns, macroeconomic factors, and the latest values of the macroeconomic factors.

The calculate_params function estimates the parameters of the factor model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. It adds a constant column to the macroeconomic factors, fits the regression model, and extracts the intercept, beta coefficients (factor loadings), and residuals. The function prints a summary of the regression results and returns the calculated parameters.

The macro_factor_model_return function calculates the return of an asset based on the macroeconomic factor model equation. It takes the intercept, beta coefficients, macroeconomic factor values, and an error term as inputs. The function multiplies the beta coefficients by the macroeconomic factor values, calculates the dot product, and adds the intercept and error term to obtain the return of the asset.

The plot_observed_vs_fitted function plots the observed returns versus the fitted values obtained from the factor model regression. It provides a visual representation of how well the model fits the observed data.

The main part of the code initializes the start and end dates, defines the Fred tickers and column names for macroeconomic factors, calls the get_stock_returns_and_macro_factors function to retrieve the data, calls the calculate_params function to estimate the factor model parameters, calculates the return of an asset using the macro_factor_model_return function, and finally, plots the observed versus fitted values using the plot_observed_vs_fitted function.

Overall, this code implements a factor model to analyze the relationship between stock returns and macroeconomic factors, estimates the model parameters using regression, and provides a visual assessment of the model's performance.
